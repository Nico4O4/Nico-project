Hi 

The file "Integer" is a calculator I coded to learn how integers and variables work.

In the code, there are some German words because it's easier for me to understand them. You can use Google Translate if you don't understand them.

The other file, named "Teleporter," is an exercise where I learn how to work with inputs, prints, and more variables.

I mostly work on the "Integer" file for now.
