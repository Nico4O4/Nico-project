Hi!

The file "Calculator" is a project I worked on to refresh my Python skills after a break. I am currently no longer working on it.

The file "pingprogram" is a script that can ping a chosen IP address and output whether it is reachable or not.

Otherwise, I upload general projects that I code here.
